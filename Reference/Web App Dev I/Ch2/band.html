	<h3>Top 3 Albums</h3>
	<dl>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<dt>Acceptance Speech</dt>
			<dd>This is the first album with Tilian Pearson as lead vocals. He keeps to clean vocals in every song on the album. The songs are well written, though some would say that some songs' lyrics are nonsense. Overall, I like every song on the album, with my favorite song being The Robot With The Human Hair pt. 4.</dd>
		</li>
		<li>
		<dt>Instant Gratification</dt>
			<dd>This is the band's 2015 album. Tilian still keeps to mostly clean vocals, except for a few times in certain songs. I like more songs from Acceptance Speech, but it's still a very good album.</dd>
		</li>
		<li>
		<dt>Mothership</dt>
			<dd>This is the most recent album from the end of 2016. Tilian begins to growl a little bit of his lyrics in some songs, most memorably in Inspire the Liars. I think that every song in it is good, and has me excited for their next album coming some time early this year.</dd>
